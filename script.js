/*
git checkout -b branchname
fast forwards can only happen if there have not been commits on the original branch 
while the new branch is being worked on
git checkout branchname
git branch -d branchname
when Git can not determine what file or folder to choose when merging since there have been 
different commits with changes to the same file
